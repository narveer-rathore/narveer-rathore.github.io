# Web Application Security

Recently, I have been trying to revisit things that had enchanted me to pursue computer science when I  was in school.  I remember computers and hacking scenes from films like **Matrix** , **Terminator**, **Swordfish**  felt like magic and power. Few **tap, tap, tap** on keyboard and targets were getting neutralised, bank accounts received millions,  bad guys got caught in an enhanced image etc.

Ahh, those days.

Movies do tickle your mind when you know nothing and they bore you when you do. We have watched [guiding missiles by SVGs](https://moviecode.tumblr.com/post/165934051645/in-doctor-who-s07e02-missiles-are-being-guided-by) to using React for [creating Hosts in Westworld](https://moviecode.tumblr.com/post/157816126320/it-seems-that-the-hosts-in-westworld-hbo-tv) but things are not that easy in the real world.

Many of the great engineers are trying very hard make applications and devices secure by default. Phones, laptops, smart watches, cars and many more are built to work without compromising any information but they do not guarantee the same if they are used under compromised environments or behavior.

To err is human. We hesitate to discover, neglect warnings and constantly overlook.

As a developer we create, build, deploy web applications every day and use various tools that reveal layers below them. What can a user do if he knows his way around these tools ?

There are trivial things that could go wrong, if we are not careful enough when developing web applications.

Let's start journey to know where we can fail and how we can avoid that.
